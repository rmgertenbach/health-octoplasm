# Healthcare Stakeholder Ecosystem Map
## Players, Relationships, Incentives, Conflicts, and Power Dynamics

*A comprehensive guide to understanding who's who, who pays whom, and why transparency matters*

---

## How to Use This Map

This document maps the entire healthcare ecosystem for self-insured employer healthcare. Use it to:

1. **Understand the players** - Who they are and what they do
2. **Follow the money** - Who pays whom and how
3. **See the incentives** - What each player wants to maximize
4. **Identify conflicts** - Where interests misalign
5. **Recognize tactics** - How players maximize their interests
6. **Spot transparency opportunities** - Where your work has impact

**Key Insight**: Almost every problem in healthcare comes from misaligned incentives. When you understand who wants what and how they get it, you understand why the system works the way it does (or doesn't).

## Part 1: The Players (Definitions)

### The Money Source

**SELF-INSURED EMPLOYERS**
- **Who**: Companies that pay medical claims directly from company funds (vs. buying insurance)
- **Examples**: Walmart, Boeing, Tesla, most Fortune 500 companies, state governments, unions
- **Scale**: Cover ~160 million Americans
- **Key Fact**: Take ALL financial risk (carriers/TPAs take none)
- **Legal Status**: ERISA fiduciaries - personally liable for prudent management
- **Budget**: Healthcare is typically second-largest expense after payroll

**EMPLOYEES/MEMBERS**
- **Who**: Workers and their families covered by employer plans
- **Key Fact**: Cost-sharing through premiums, deductibles, copays, coinsurance
- **Typical Burden**: 20-30% of premiums + all cost-sharing until out-of-pocket max
- **Pain Point**: "Functionally uninsured" if deductible exceeds bank balance

### The Middlemen (Administrative Layer)

**CARRIERS/ASOs (Administrative Services Only)**
- **Who**: Big insurance companies (Blue Cross Blue Shield, United, Cigna, Aetna, Humana)
- **Role for self-insured**: NOT insurance - just administrative services
- **What they do**: Process claims, manage networks, prior authorization, member services
- **Key Fact**: Take NO financial risk for self-insured employers (employer takes all risk)
- **Get paid**: PMPM fees + spread pricing + float + subsidiary fees
- **Examples**: Blue Cross acting as ASO for Boeing (Boeing takes risk, BC just administers)

**TPAs (Third-Party Administrators)**
- **Who**: Companies that administer health plans for self-insured employers
- **Two types**: 
  - Carrier TPAs (Blue Cross, United acting as ASO)
  - Independent TPAs (smaller, specialized firms)
- **What they do**: Same as ASOs - claims processing, network access, reporting
- **Key Difference from ASO**: Usually smaller, sometimes more flexible
- **Get paid**: PMPM fees + potentially spread pricing
- **Problem**: Often claim network contracts are "proprietary"

**PBMs (Pharmacy Benefit Managers)**
- **Who**: Companies managing prescription drug benefits
- **Big Three**: CVS/Caremark, OptumRx, Express Scripts (~80% market share)
- **What they do**: Create formularies, negotiate with pharmacies, process drug claims
- **Get paid**: Spread pricing (massive), rebates (may not pass through), DIR fees
- **Key Fact**: Often owned by carriers (vertical integration)
- **Example**: United owns OptumRx, CVS owns Caremark

**CONSULTANTS/BROKERS (EBCs - Employee Benefit Consultants)**
- **Who**: Advisors hired by employers to design and manage health benefits
- **Big players**: Mercer, Aon, Willis Towers Watson, smaller regional brokers
- **What they do**: Benefits strategy, carrier selection, renewals, compliance
- **Get paid**: 
  - **Fee-based**: Employer pays directly (unconflicted)
  - **Commission**: Carrier pays percentage of premium (conflicted)
  - **Hybrid**: Both (somewhat conflicted)
- **Problem**: Many have undisclosed financial relationships with carriers/TPAs

### The Care Delivery

**PROVIDERS (Hospitals/Health Systems)**
- **Who**: Where actual care is delivered
- **Types**: Academic medical centers, community hospitals, specialty hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers
- **Key Fact**: Increasingly consolidated (single system owning many hospitals in region)
- **Get paid**: Fee-for-service, bundled payments, direct contracts
- **Problem**: Market concentration = monopoly pricing power

**PROVIDERS (Physician Practices)**
- **Who**: Doctors providing care
- **Types**: 
  - Independent practices (declining rapidly)
  - Hospital-employed (growing)
  - PE-backed groups (growing)
- **Get paid**: Fee-for-service, capitation, salary (if employed)
- **Problem**: 1 administrator per 2 physicians (billing complexity)

**CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE (COEs)**
- **Who**: Providers designated for specific procedures (hip replacement, cancer care, etc.)
- **Why designated**: High quality + fair pricing + outcomes guarantees
- **Examples**: Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, specialty orthopedic centers
- **Get paid**: Often bundled rates (one price for entire episode)
- **Key Fact**: When designed well, deliver better outcomes at lower cost

### The Support Functions

**REINSURANCE/STOP-LOSS CARRIERS**
- **Who**: Insurance for self-insured employers against catastrophic claims
- **What they do**: Cover individual claims above threshold ($50K, $100K, $250K, etc.)
- **Get paid**: Premium (PMPM or annual)
- **Key Fact**: Only entity besides employer taking financial risk
- **Problem**: Can "laser" (exclude) high-cost individuals

**UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT (UM) COMPANIES**
- **Who**: Companies managing prior authorization and medical necessity review
- **What they do**: Approve/deny services before they happen
- **Get paid**: PMPM fees or percentage of "savings" (denied claims)
- **Problem**: Incentive to deny = incentive to delay/deny care

**NAVIGATION/STEERING COMPANIES**
- **Who**: Services helping employees find appropriate, affordable care
- **What they do**: Direct patients to high-value providers
- **Get paid**: PMPM, per-interaction, or shared savings
- **Quality varies**: Some excellent, some just steering to whoever pays them

**DATA/ANALYTICS VENDORS**
- **Who**: Companies providing data analysis and insights (THIS IS YOU)
- **What they do**: Claims analysis, benchmarking, transparency tools, quality scoring
- **Get paid**: Subscription, per-employer fees, licensing
- **Key Fact**: Can be unconflicted (ideal) or have conflicts (problematic)

### The Regulators and Standards Bodies

**DEPARTMENT OF LABOR (DOL)**
- **Who**: Federal agency enforcing ERISA (fiduciary standards)
- **Role**: Investigate complaints, enforce transparency rules, penalize violations
- **Key Fact**: Increased enforcement post-CAA

**CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)**
- **Who**: Federal agency setting transparency rules, hospital pricing requirements
- **Role**: Enforcement of transparency regulations
- **Key Fact**: Medicare rates often used as benchmark for commercial contracts

**LEAPFROG GROUP**
- **Who**: Nonprofit hospital safety rating organization
- **What they do**: Assign safety grades (A-F) based on errors, infections, practices
- **Funded by**: Employers and other purchasers
- **Key Fact**: Only major independent hospital safety rating

### Other Players

**PRIVATE EQUITY (PE)**
- **Role**: Buying up physician practices, hospitals, PBMs, specialty pharmacies
- **Goal**: Financial returns (typically 20%+ annually)
- **Tactics**: Consolidation, cost-cutting, revenue maximization, price increases
- **Problem**: Healthcare as financial asset vs. patient care

**MANUFACTURERS (Drug/Device)**
- **Role**: Make drugs and medical devices
- **Key Fact**: Negotiate rebates with PBMs (may not reach employers/patients)
- **Problem**: High list prices create need for "rebates" (price opacity)

### Key Relationships Explained

**Employer → Consultant**:
- Employer hires consultant to advise on benefits strategy
- **Ideal**: Consultant paid fee-only by employer (unconflicted)
- **Reality**: Often paid commission by carriers (conflicted)

**Employer → TPA/ASO**:
- Employer hires TPA to administer plan
- TPA processes claims, manages network, handles member services
- **Problem**: TPA may have undisclosed spread pricing

**TPA → Provider Network**:
- TPA negotiates rates with hospitals/doctors
- Providers agree to "contracted rates"
- **Problem**: Employer doesn't see actual rates, can't verify value

**TPA → PBM**:
- TPA typically bundles with PBM or hires separate PBM
- PBM manages all pharmacy benefits
- **Problem**: Often owned by same parent company (United owns OptumRx)

**Employer → Reinsurer**:
- Employer buys stop-loss insurance for catastrophic claims
- Only entity besides employer taking financial risk
- **Critical**: Makes self-insurance feasible for mid-size employers

**Employees → Everyone**:
- Pay premium share to employer
- Pay cost-sharing to providers (deductible, copays, coinsurance)
- Receive care from providers
- Pick up prescriptions from pharmacies
- **Problem**: No transparency into costs until after care

---

## Part 3: The Money Flows (Who Pays Whom)

### Primary Money Flows

```
EMPLOYER'S MONEY FLOWS:

1. To TPA/ASO:
   - PMPM administrative fees ($25-$75 PMPM typical)
   - Hidden spread pricing (20-40% markup on claims)
   - Float income (investment returns on held money)
   
2. To PBM:
   - PMPM pharmacy admin fees
   - Spread pricing on drugs (can be 100-600% markup)
   - Rebates that don't get passed through
   
3. To Providers (via TPA):
   - Medical claims (hospitals, doctors, facilities)
   - Note: TPA processes payment but $ comes from employer
   
4. To Pharmacies (via PBM):
   - Drug costs
   - Note: PBM processes but $ comes from employer
   
5. To Consultant:
   - Annual fees ($100K-$500K+ depending on size)
   - OR commission from carriers (5-8% of premium)
   
6. To Reinsurer:
   - Stop-loss premiums ($300-$700 PMPM typical for family coverage)
   
7. To Employees (indirect):
   - Premium subsidies (employer pays 70-80% of premium)
   - HSA contributions
   - Wellness incentives

EMPLOYEE'S MONEY FLOWS:

1. To Employer:
   - Premium share (20-30% of premium, payroll deduction)
   
2. To Providers:
   - Deductible (first $1,500-$5,000)
   - Coinsurance (typically 20% of costs after deductible)
   - Copays ($25-$100 per visit)
   
3. To Pharmacies:
   - Prescription copays/coinsurance
```

### Hidden Money Flows (The Dark Matter)

```
SPREAD PRICING (Medical):
Employer → TPA → Provider
  $13,000    $10,000  (TPA keeps $3,000 spread)

SPREAD PRICING (Pharmacy):
Employer → PBM → Pharmacy
  $150      $25      (PBM keeps $125 spread)

REBATES:
Manufacturer → PBM → ??? (Should go to Employer, often doesn't)
  $1,000        $300 passed through ($700 kept by PBM)

UNDERPAYMENTS:
TPA bills Employer $10,000 for claim
TPA pays Provider $9,500
TPA keeps $500 (employer doesn't know)

SUBSIDIARY TRANSFERS:
Insurance Carrier Parent Company:
- Owns TPA → charges admin fees
- Owns PBM → charges pharmacy fees
- Owns specialty pharmacy → charges dispensing fees
- Owns medical group → pays itself for care
All counted as "medical costs" (MLR compliant!)
Example: $161 billion annual intercompany transfers at one major carrier

FLOAT:
Employer pays premium/claims budget: Jan 1
TPA pays actual claims: 45-90 days later
TPA invests money in between: Keeps investment income
Scale: Billions in float = tens/hundreds of millions in investment income
```

## Part 4: The Incentive Matrix (What Each Player Wants)

### Aligned with Patient/Employer Interests ✓

**SELF-INSURED EMPLOYERS** (when acting as fiduciaries)
- **Primary Goal**: Lower costs + healthy employees + regulatory compliance
- **Incentive**: Every dollar saved = dollar for wages, profit, or better benefits
- **Metric**: Total cost of care, outcomes, employee satisfaction
- **Problem**: Often lack expertise to achieve goals

**EMPLOYEES/PATIENTS**
- **Primary Goal**: Affordable, accessible, quality healthcare
- **Incentive**: Stay healthy, avoid financial ruin, get good care when sick
- **Metric**: Out-of-pocket costs, health outcomes, convenience
- **Problem**: No information to make good choices

**UNCONFLICTED CONSULTANTS**
- **Primary Goal**: Help employer reduce costs and improve outcomes
- **Incentive**: Paid fee by employer for results
- **Metric**: Client savings, retention, referrals
- **Advantage**: Incentives aligned with employer

**INDEPENDENT TPAs** (when truly independent)
- **Primary Goal**: Provide excellent administrative services
- **Incentive**: Retain clients through good service
- **Metric**: Client satisfaction, contract renewal
- **Note**: Only if no hidden spread pricing

**HIGH-VALUE PROVIDERS** (quality + fair price)
- **Primary Goal**: Deliver excellent care at sustainable price
- **Incentive**: Volume through reputation, direct contracts
- **Metric**: Outcomes, patient satisfaction, fair payment
- **Advantage**: Win when transparency reveals their value

**DIRECT PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES**
- **Primary Goal**: Great patient relationships, good outcomes
- **Incentive**: Monthly membership, paid by patient/employer directly
- **Metric**: Patient satisfaction, retention
- **Advantage**: No insurance billing complexity

**PASS-THROUGH PBMs**
- **Primary Goal**: Efficient pharmacy benefit administration
- **Incentive**: Flat fee (not percentage), client retention
- **Metric**: Drug cost reduction, transparency
- **Advantage**: Lower drug costs = proven value

### Misaligned with Patient/Employer Interests ✗

**CARRIERS/ASOs** (for self-insured)
- **Stated Goal**: "Partner with employers for employee health"
- **Actual Incentive**: Maximize revenue from administrative fees + spread pricing + float + subsidiary profits
- **Key Misalignment**: Higher costs = higher percentage-based fees = more spread dollars
- **Metric**: Revenue per member, profit margin
- **Tactic**: Complexity, opacity, vertical integration
- **Quote**: "If the published price is X and the claim is X times three, you're gonna have to start being accountable for that spend"

**TRADITIONAL PBMs**
- **Stated Goal**: "Lower drug costs through negotiation"
- **Actual Incentive**: Maximize spread pricing + keep rebates + DIR fees
- **Key Misalignment**: Higher drug list prices = higher rebates = more profit (even if net cost to employer is higher)
- **Metric**: Gross profit, rebate revenue
- **Tactic**: Opaque pricing, rebate retention, spread pricing
- **Example**: NADAC = $20, PBM charges $150, pays pharmacy $25, keeps $125

**CONFLICTED CONSULTANTS/BROKERS**
- **Stated Goal**: "Advise employers on best benefits strategy"
- **Actual Incentive**: Commission from carriers (5-8% of premium)
- **Key Misalignment**: Higher premiums = higher commission
- **Metric**: Commission revenue, carrier relationships
- **Tactic**: Recommend carriers who pay most, not best value
- **Problem**: Won't recommend direct contracting (no commission)

**CONSOLIDATED HEALTH SYSTEMS** (market dominant)
- **Stated Goal**: "High-quality comprehensive care"
- **Actual Incentive**: Maximize revenue through volume + high prices
- **Key Misalignment**: Market power used for pricing, not quality improvement
- **Metric**: Revenue, margin, market share
- **Tactic**: Consolidation, all-or-nothing contracts, facility fees
- **Data Point**: Highest prices often have lowest quality

**HOSPITAL-EMPLOYED PHYSICIAN GROUPS**
- **Stated Goal**: "Integrated care"
- **Actual Incentive**: Drive revenue to parent hospital system
- **Key Misalignment**: Referrals/admissions to parent hospital regardless of value
- **Metric**: Hospital revenue, utilization
- **Tactic**: "Facility fees" when same doctor in same office now owned by hospital

**PRIVATE EQUITY-BACKED PROVIDERS**
- **Stated Goal**: "Efficient care delivery"
- **Actual Incentive**: 20%+ annual returns for investors
- **Key Misalignment**: Financial engineering vs. patient care
- **Metric**: EBITDA, IRR
- **Tactic**: Upcoding, surprise billing, staffing cuts, price increases
- **Timeline**: Extract maximum value over 3-7 years, then sell

**UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT COMPANIES** (when incentivized on denials)
- **Stated Goal**: "Appropriate utilization"
- **Actual Incentive**: Maximize "savings" through denials
- **Key Misalignment**: Deny care that might be appropriate
- **Metric**: Denial rate, "savings"
- **Tactic**: Aggressive prior auth, peer-to-peer requirements, delays
- **Problem**: 50% of denials overturned on appeal

### Partially Aligned / Complex

**REINSURANCE/STOP-LOSS CARRIERS**
- **Aligned**: Want to avoid catastrophic claims (partner on prevention)
- **Misaligned**: May "laser" high-cost individuals (exclusions)
- **Neutral**: Just pricing risk, not administering care

**ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS**
- **Aligned**: Often highest quality for complex cases
- **Misaligned**: Highest prices even for routine care
- **Complex**: Research/teaching missions increase costs

**MANUFACTURERS (Drug/Device)**
- **Aligned**: Innovation, life-saving products
- **Misaligned**: High list prices, rebate games, patent extensions
- **Complex**: R&D costs justify some pricing, but exploitation common

---

## Part 5: The Conflict Map (Who's Fighting Whom and Why)

### Primary Conflicts

#### CONFLICT 1: Employers vs. TPAs/Carriers

**The Fight**: Employer wants transparency and low costs. TPA/Carrier wants opacity and high costs (more spread).

**Employer Weapons**:
- CAA (legal right to data)
- Fiduciary duty leverage (can sue)
- Market power (threaten to switch)
- Direct contracting (bypass TPA)
- Transparency data (expose overcharging)

**TPA/Carrier Weapons**:
- "Proprietary" contracts (hide rates)
- Complexity (overwhelm employer)
- Network lock-in ("you need our network")
- Switching costs (hard to change mid-year)
- Delay tactics (10 months to release data)

**Current Status**: Employers gaining ground (CAA enforcement, PBGH data, growing sophistication)

**Your Role**: Transparency tools tip balance toward employers

---

#### CONFLICT 2: Employers vs. Consultants (Conflicted)

**The Fight**: Employer wants unbiased advice. Consultant wants commission from carrier relationships.

**Employer Weapons**:
- Demand fee-only compensation
- Request disclosure of all commissions
- Require fiduciary standard in contract
- Switch to unconflicted consultant
- Do analysis in-house

**Consultant Weapons**:
- Complexity (employer needs expertise)
- Relationships (years of trust)
- Information asymmetry (consultant knows more)
- Inertia (easier to stay than switch)

**Current Status**: Employers waking up (PBGH data revealing bad advice)

**Flashpoint**: Consultant called to HQ, can't explain why employer paying 30% more than peers

**Your Role**: Transparency reveals which consultants actually help vs. collect commissions

---

#### CONFLICT 3: Employers vs. Consolidated Health Systems

**The Fight**: Employer wants fair prices for quality care. Hospital system wants maximum prices regardless of quality.

**Employer Weapons**:
- Narrow networks (exclude expensive systems)
- Direct contracts (negotiate outside TPA)
- COE programs (send complex cases elsewhere)
- Steering/navigation (guide to high-value alternatives)
- Financial incentives (lower copays at preferred providers)
- Transparency (show employees the options)

**Hospital System Weapons**:
- Market dominance ("we're the only game in town")
- Brand recognition ("prestigious" name)
- All-or-nothing contracts ("take all facilities or none")
- Political influence (jobs, economic impact)
- Patient loyalty (doctors, convenience)

**Example**: 32BJ Health Fund kicked expensive hospital from network
- Result: Biggest member raises ever, employer premium holiday
- Required: Sophisticated analysis, strong communication, alternatives available

**Current Status**: Employers rarely do this (too hard, too risky)

**Your Role**: Transparency data shows which hospitals actually deserve premium prices

---

#### CONFLICT 4: Employers vs. PBMs

**The Fight**: Employer wants low net drug costs. PBM wants high list prices (more rebates to keep) and maximum spread.

**Employer Weapons**:
- Pass-through PBM contracts (flat fee, no spread)
- NADAC benchmarking (see true drug costs)
- Formulary control (employer decides, not PBM)
- Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drugs (bypass PBM entirely)
- Transparency requirements (show all costs)

**PBM Weapons**:
- Opaque pricing (MAC lists, AWP discounts)
- Rebate retention (keep manufacturer payments)
- Spread pricing (100-600% markups)
- Vertical integration (own pharmacies, force use)
- Complexity (nobody understands PBM contracts)

**Example**: Generic drug NADAC cost $20, PBM charges employer $150, pays pharmacy $25, keeps $125

**Current Status**: Growing employer awareness, but most still in traditional PBM contracts

**Your Role**: Transparency shows spread pricing, enables pass-through model

---

#### CONFLICT 5: Good Providers vs. Bad Providers

**The Fight**: High-quality, fair-priced providers want volume. Low-quality, expensive providers want to hide behind brand and TPA contracts.

**Good Provider Weapons**:
- Actual quality data (Leapfrog A grade)
- Transparent pricing (willing to publish)
- Direct contracts (bypass TPA margin)
- Outcomes data (prove value)
- Patient satisfaction

**Bad Provider Weapons**:
- Brand recognition (billboards, sponsorships)
- TPA contracts (employer doesn't see alternatives)
- Geographic convenience
- Opacity (prevent quality comparisons)
- All-or-nothing deals (can't be excluded)

**Current Status**: Good providers frustrated (Dr. Rodis story - improved safety, no volume increase because employers didn't know)

**Your Role**: Transparency reveals true quality, creates merit-based competition

---

#### CONFLICT 6: Independent Providers vs. Consolidated Systems

**The Fight**: Independent practices want to survive. Consolidated systems want to acquire them or price them out.

**Independent Weapons**:
- Lower overhead (no corporate bureaucracy)
- Personal relationships (patient loyalty)
- Flexibility (can direct contract easily)
- Often better quality (less pressure for volume)

**Consolidated System Weapons**:
- Negotiating power with TPAs (volume leverage)
- Access to capital (can operate at loss to gain market share)
- Comprehensive services (full continuum of care)
- Brand recognition
- Political influence

**Current Status**: Independents losing (rapid consolidation)

**Employer Impact**: Less choice, higher prices, less negotiating leverage

**Your Role**: Transparency helps employers identify and support independent high-value providers through direct contracts

---

#### CONFLICT 7: Patients vs. Everyone (Financial)

**The Fight**: Patients want affordable care. Almost everyone else makes more money when care is expensive.

**Patient Weapons**:
- Theoretically can shop (but no info to do so)
- Can complain to employer (but employer may not care)
- Can delay care (but get sicker)
- Can bankruptcy (last resort)

**Everyone Else's Weapons**:
- Surprise bills (can't shop after emergency)
- Opacity (don't know costs until after)
- High deductibles (patient pays first $3,000-$5,000)
- Complexity (impossible to navigate)
- Medical necessity (can't really "choose" not to get care)

**Current Status**: Patients losing badly (medical bankruptcy, delayed care, choosing food over medicine)

**The Hope**: Employers, as fiduciaries, should fight for patients (employees)

**Your Role**: Transparency empowers employers to design benefits that actually help patients

---

### Alliance Patterns

**The Good Guys (Aligned Interests)**:
- Employers (when acting as fiduciaries)
- Employees/Patients
- Unconflicted consultants
- Independent TPAs (no spread pricing)
- Pass-through PBMs
- High-value providers
- Direct primary care
- Transparency advocates (PBGH, you)

**The Status Quo (Benefiting from Opacity)**:
- Traditional carriers/ASOs
- Traditional PBMs
- Conflicted consultants
- Low-value/high-price providers
- Consolidated systems (in monopoly markets)
- Private equity (extracting value)

**The Wild Cards (Could Go Either Way)**:
- Regulators (depend on political will)
- Reinsurers (just pricing risk)
- Manufacturers (innovation vs. exploitation)
- Academic medical centers (quality vs. price)

---

## Part 6: The Power & Levers (What Tactics Each Player Uses)

### CARRIERS/ASOs/TPAs - Power Levers

**Lever 1: Network Control**
- **Tactic**: "You need our network to ensure access"
- **Reality**: Can buy wraparound network for $18 PMPM; most care from small number of providers
- **Counter**: Direct contracting + wraparound for exceptions

**Lever 2: Data Withholding**
- **Tactic**: Claim contracts are "proprietary," delay data requests 10+ months
- **Reality**: CAA says employer owns the data
- **Counter**: Legal demand letters, DOL complaints, contract terms requiring data access

**Lever 3: Complexity**
- **Tactic**: Make everything incomprehensible (reports, contracts, pricing)
- **Reality**: Deliberately complex to prevent employer understanding
- **Counter**: Hire healthcare CFO, use transparency tools

## Part 7: The Transparency Impact (How Your Work Shifts Power)

### Before Transparency

```
POWER BALANCE:

MOST POWER:
├─ Consolidated Health Systems (monopoly pricing)
├─ Traditional Carriers/TPAs (control data, networks)
├─ Traditional PBMs (spread pricing, rebate retention)
└─ Conflicted Consultants (information asymmetry)

MEDIUM POWER:
├─ Large Employers (have leverage but don't use it)
└─ Manufacturers (high prices but visible)

LITTLE POWER:
├─ Small/Mid Employers (can't negotiate, dependent on vendors)
├─ Independent Providers (consolidation pressure)
├─ Patients (no information, high deductibles)
└─ Unconflicted Consultants (can't prove value vs. conflicted peers)
```

### After Transparency

```
POWER SHIFTS:

GAINING POWER:
├─ Employers (data enables smart buying) ⬆⬆⬆
├─ Patients (can see costs/quality before care) ⬆⬆
├─ High-Value Providers (quality visible, competitive advantage) ⬆⬆
├─ Unconflicted Consultants (can prove value) ⬆⬆
└─ Independent Providers (easier to direct contract) ⬆

LOSING POWER:
├─ Traditional TPAs (spread pricing exposed) ⬇⬇⬇
├─ Traditional PBMs (same) ⬇⬇⬇
├─ Conflicted Consultants (conflicts exposed) ⬇⬇
├─ Low-Value Providers (quality scores visible) ⬇⬇
└─ Monopoly Systems (harder to hide bad value) ⬇
```

### Specific Transparency Interventions

**INTERVENTION 1: Claims + Transparency Data Combination** (PBGH model)
- **Exposes**: Overpayment vs. peers, vs. benchmarks
- **Shifts Power**: Employer → TPA accountability
- **Example**: "You negotiated rates 30% higher than peers. Explain."

**INTERVENTION 2: Quality Scores Integrated with Price**
- **Exposes**: Expensive ≠ Better (often opposite)
- **Shifts Power**: High-value provider competitive advantage
- **Example**: "System A: $42K, C grade. System B: $18K, A grade. Why would I use A?"

**INTERVENTION 3: Spread Pricing Visibility**
- **Exposes**: Hidden markups (medical and pharmacy)
- **Shifts Power**: Enables pass-through contracts
- **Example**: "You charged us $150, paid pharmacy $25, kept $125. That's theft."

**INTERVENTION 4: Peer Benchmarking**
- **Exposes**: Relative performance
- **Shifts Power**: Creates competitive pressure
- **Example**: "Other employers pay $X for this. We pay $Y. Fix it."

**INTERVENTION 5: Direct Contract Price Visibility**
- **Exposes**: TPA rates worse than direct
- **Shifts Power**: Enables bypass of TPA
- **Example**: "We can direct contract for 25% less. What do we need you for?"

**INTERVENTION 6: Total Cost of Care by Provider**
- **Exposes**: Downstream costs of poor quality
- **Shifts Power**: Rewards outcomes, not volume
- **Example**: "Cheap surgery but 30% complication rate costs us more total."

**INTERVENTION 7: Site of Service Cost Variation**
- **Exposes**: Identical service, huge price variation
- **Shifts Power**: Enables steering/navigation
- **Example**: "Hospital MRI: $3K. Independent center: $400. Same machine, same quality."

**INTERVENTION 8: Consultant Conflict Disclosure**
- **Exposes**: Hidden commissions
- **Shifts Power**: Unconflicted consultants win
- **Example**: "Our consultant gets 7% commission from carrier. Their advice makes sense now."

**INTERVENTION 9: Network Value Analysis**
- **Exposes**: "High-value networks" often aren't
- **Shifts Power**: Enables custom network design
- **Example**: "Your 'high-performance' network includes lowest-quality, highest-cost providers."

**INTERVENTION 10: Fiduciary Compliance Documentation**
- **Exposes**: Employers not using available data = liability
- **Shifts Power**: Legal mandate to use transparency
- **Example**: "DOL asks: 'Did you use transparency data?' 'No.' 'Why not?' [No good answer]"

**The informational problem**: Opacity enables extraction

**Your solution**: Transparency realigns incentives and enables accountability

---

### The Power Shift You're Creating

**From**: Trust-based opacity
**To**: Verify-based transparency

**From**: Status quo protects incumbents
**To**: Data empowers customers

**From**: Complexity as weapon
**To**: Simplicity as service

**From**: Conflicts hidden
**To**: Conflicts exposed

**From**: Market failure
**To**: Market function

---

### Your North Star

Every day, ask: **"Does this increase transparency or protect opacity?"**

If transparency: Do more
If opacity: Stop immediately

Stay unconflicted. Stay focused on employer/patient benefit. Let the chips fall where they may for incumbents.

---

### The Endgame

**2028 Vision**:
- Employer calls TPA: "What's the price for this service?"
- TPA answers immediately with actual number
- Employer compares to benchmark (using your tool)
- Employer negotiates or switches (market working)
