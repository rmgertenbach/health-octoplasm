# Transparency in Action: The PBGH Story and What It Means for Real People
## How Access to Cost, Quality, and Safety Data Changes Everything

*Building on Healthcare Finance Fundamentals - A Practical Case Study*

---

## Executive Summary: Why This Matters to You

If you're working in healthcare transparency, you just witnessed the equivalent of the Wright Brothers' first flight. The PBGH (Purchaser Business Group on Health) Transparency Demonstration Project proved that:

1. **It CAN be done** - Combining cost, quality, and safety data is technically feasible
2. **People WANT it** - There's enormous unmet demand from employers
3. **It WORKS** - Employers are finding 30%+ overpayments and redesigning their entire approach
4. **The game is changing** - TPAs and consultants are getting called to HQ to explain themselves

**For your work**: This is proof that transparency tools have real market power. The data exists. The demand exists. The impact is measurable and dramatic.

**For real people**: This means families potentially keeping $5,000+ more per year. It means safer hospitals. It means not choosing between groceries and insulin. It means the healthcare system might actually start working.

## Part 1: What PBGH Actually Did (And Why It Matters)

### The Setup

**The Players**:
- **PBGH**: Trade association representing jumbo employers who spend $350+ billion annually on healthcare
- **Milliman**: Actuarial firm (the serious math people)
- **Embold**: Quality data provider
- **Leapfrog**: Hospital safety scoring organization
- **Peterson Center on Healthcare**: Funder (critically, unconflicted)

**The Challenge**: 
Everyone said transparency data (MRFs - machine-readable files) was "unusable." The industry claimed it couldn't be done. Too messy. Too incomplete. Too complex.

**PBGH's Response**: 
"That sort of made me wanna try more." - Elizabeth Mitchell

### The Secret Sauce: Data Triangulation

**What They Combined**:

```
1. Employer Claims Data (receipts - what was actually paid)
   +
2. Transparency Data/MRFs (rates - what should have been paid)
   +
3. Quality Data from Embold (outcomes - was it good care?)
   +
4. Safety Data from Leapfrog (safety grades - was it safe care?)
   =
Complete Picture of Value (cost + quality + safety)
```

**Why This Works**:
- Claims data alone = just receipts (don't know if you overpaid)
- Transparency data alone = incomplete, gaps, compliance issues
- Quality data alone = don't know what it cost
- **Combined** = you know what you paid, what you should have paid, and what you got for your money

**The Analogy**:
It's like finally getting an itemized restaurant bill with Yelp reviews included. You can see:
- What you were charged ($43 for a burger)
- What everyone else paid ($12-$18 for same burger)
- Whether the burger was any good (2 stars, health code violations)
- The restaurant across the street (5 stars, $15 burger)

### The Results: Better Than Expected

**Technical Feasibility**: ✓ Proven
**Employer Demand**: ✓ Overwhelming (can't keep up)
**Actionable Insights**: ✓ Employers making major changes
**Market Impact**: ✓ TPAs and consultants scrambling

**Elizabeth Mitchell's Assessment**: 
"It worked even better than we had expected."

## Part 2: Real-World Impact - What Actually Happened

### Discovery #1: Employers Were Overpaying Massively

**The Shock**:
One employer discovered she was paying **30% more than her peers** for the exact same healthcare services.

**The Betrayal**:
Her "trusted" consultants and carriers had been assuring her she was getting great rates. They showed her impressive "discounts."

**The Reality** (connecting to your previous terminology guide):
- Consultant said: "You're getting 40% off!"
- Reality: 40% off a chargemaster price that's 300% too high
- Like buying a $10 item marked up to $100, then "discounted" to $60
- You didn't save $40. You overpaid by $50.

**The Human Impact**:
- That 30% overpayment = potentially $3,000-$5,000+ per family
- Money that could have been wages
- Money that could have been lower premiums
- Money that could have been better benefits
- Instead: disappeared into spread pricing and hidden fees

**Real People Affected**:
If this employer has 10,000 employees:
- 10,000 employees × $5,000 overpayment = $50 million annually
- $50 million = 500 jobs at $100K salary
- Or significant raises for everyone
- Or fully-funded 401(k) matches
- Or $0 deductibles for everyone

### Discovery #2: Price and Quality Have ZERO Correlation

**The Finding**:
"There is almost no correlation...Price and quality are not correlated. We found, many cases, the highest price providers had the lowest quality, and those were some of the big brand names."

**What This Means**:
Those hospitals with:
- The biggest billboards
- The sports arena naming rights
- The fancy lobbies
- The "prestige" brand
- The highest prices

Often had:
- The LOWEST quality scores
- The WORST safety grades
- The HIGHEST complication rates

**The T-Shirt Analogy Revisited** (from Mark Cuban conversation):
You're not choosing between Target and Nordstrom t-shirts.
You're being charged Nordstrom prices for a t-shirt that's actually worse quality than Target.
And your consultant kept telling you it was a "great deal."

**Real Person Example**:
Sarah needs a hip replacement. Her options:

```
MegaHealth System (the "prestigious" one):
- Cost: $42,000
- Leapfrog Grade: C
- Billboard: Yes (on the highway, at the baseball stadium)
- What they tell you: "Premier care, world-class facility"

Community Orthopedic Specialists:
- Cost: $18,000
- Leapfrog Grade: A
- Billboard: No
- What they tell you: Nothing (you didn't know they existed)
```

**Without transparency**: Sarah goes to MegaHealth (in-network, "trusted brand")
- Costs employer $42,000
- Sarah pays $4,200 in coinsurance (if she has 90/10 after deductible)
- Higher complication risk

**With transparency**: Sarah goes to Community Ortho
- Costs employer $18,000
- Employer offers $0 copay (can afford it with savings)
- Sarah pays $0
- Better outcomes, safer care
- Employer saves $24,000 (can give raises, lower premiums)

**Scale this across 100 hip replacements**: 
$2.4 million in savings + better outcomes for patients

### Discovery #3: Direct Contracts Beat TPA Negotiations

**The Finding**:
"The directly contracted arrangements were higher value than anything negotiated by the TPAs."

**Translation**:
- When employers negotiated directly with hospitals: Better prices, better terms
- When TPAs negotiated on employers' behalf: Worse prices, worse terms
- Remember: Employer is paying the TPA to negotiate on their behalf

**Why This Happens** (connecting to your previous materials):

**TPA Incentive Structure**:
```
TPA gets paid:
- Administrative fees (PMPM)
- Spread pricing (difference between what they charge employer and pay provider)
- Potential kickbacks/rebates from providers
- Float (investment income on money held before paying claims)

TPA does NOT get paid more for:
- Lowering costs
- Finding high-quality providers
- Aggressive negotiation that angers provider partners
```

**Employer Incentive Structure**:
```
Employer benefits from:
- Lower healthcare costs (second biggest expense after payroll)
- Healthier employees (less absenteeism, better productivity)
- Competitive advantage (can offer better benefits or wages)
- Avoiding lawsuits (fiduciary duty under CAA)

Employer does NOT benefit from:
- TPA's spread pricing
- Provider relationships that serve TPA's interests
- Status quo that keeps costs high
```

**The Conflict**:
TPA saying "we negotiated great rates" may mean:
- Great for the TPA (they make more money)
- Terrible for the employer (they pay more)

**Real Example from Transcript**:
One TPA told employer it took **10 months** to release the employer's own data. Had to bring in attorneys. TPA kept saying "it's proprietary."

**Translation**: "We don't want you to see how much we're overcharging you."

### Discovery #4: Site of Service Variation is "Dramatic"

**The Finding**:
"If you could have the exact same service from a high quality provider and pay literally half by going to one location..."

**Real Examples** (from earlier episodes referenced):

**Infusion Therapy**:
- Hospital outpatient infusion center: $1,200,000
- Freestanding infusion center across the street: $600,000
- Same drug, same nurse, same chair, same IV
- Difference: $600,000

**Imaging (MRI)**:
- Hospital-based MRI: $3,000
- Independent imaging center: $400
- Same machine, same quality, same radiologist reading
- Difference: $2,600

**Why This Happens**:
- Hospital "facility fees" (charges just for being in hospital building)
- Hospital market power (can demand higher rates)
- Insurance contracts that don't differentiate by site
- Patients don't know there's a choice
- Even if they know, cost-sharing is same regardless

**The Human Impact**:

**Meet Tom**:
- Has $5,000 deductible (not yet met)
- Needs MRI for back pain
- Doctor says "get an MRI"

**Without transparency**:
- Goes to hospital (it's in-network, seems legitimate)
- Gets bill for $3,000
- Tom pays $3,000 (still under deductible)
- Tom now has credit card debt
- Tom delays other care because he can't afford it

**With transparency and navigation**:
- Navigation service says "go to XYZ Imaging Center"
- Same quality, $400
- Employer offers $0 copay at preferred site
- Tom pays $0
- Tom stays healthy, keeps his money, remains productive at work
- Employer saves $2,600+ and has happier, healthier employee

**Scale across 1,000 MRIs**: $2.6 million in savings

### Discovery #5: "High-Value Networks" Aren't

**The Finding**:
"These so-called like high value networks or whatever, they're branded aren't."

**What Carriers Call "High-Value Networks"**:
- "High-performance network"
- "Value network"
- "Narrow network"
- "Tiered network"
- "Centers of Excellence"

**What Employers Found**:
Nobody knows what quality metrics are actually being used.

**Elizabeth Mitchell**: "They're saying something, oh, this is a high value, high quality network. Based on what? Based on what metrics?"

**The Scam** (harsh word, but accurate):

**Marketing Promise**: 
"We've carefully curated the highest-quality, most efficient providers"

**Actual Reality** (often):
"We picked providers who give us the best deals/biggest kickbacks, regardless of quality"

**How to Tell the Difference**:
Ask these questions:
1. What specific quality metrics are you using?
2. Can I see the methodology?
3. Can I see each provider's quality scores?
4. Are you excluding providers for quality or just for price?
5. Do you have financial relationships with included providers?

**If they can't/won't answer**: Not a real high-value network.

**Real High-Value Network** (from PBGH's earlier COE program):
- Individual clinician level (down to NPI)
- Transparent, rigorous quality standards
- Evidence-based criteria
- Outcomes tracking
- Continuous monitoring
- Providers held accountable

**Results from that program**: "Phenomenal"

## Part 3: The Uncomfortable Conversations (TPAs and Consultants Get Called to HQ)

### The Boardroom Moment

**The Scene**:
Large employer's C-suite discovers through PBGH data:
- They're paying 30% more than peers
- Their "high-value network" has lowest-quality providers at highest prices
- Their TPA's rates are worse than direct contracts
- The cash price is often cheaper than their "negotiated rates"

**Who Gets Called In**:
- The longtime consultant (who's been assuring them everything is fine)
- The TPA/carrier rep (who negotiated the "great" rates)
- The account manager (who's been handling renewals)

**The Questions** (that are now possible with data):

**Question 1**: 
"You've been showing us discount reports for years. Why are we paying 30% more than our peers for the same services?"

**Consultant stammering**: 
"Well, discounts are measured against chargemaster rates..."

**CFO**: 
"So the baseline you're measuring against is meaningless?"

**Question 2**:
"You told us this was a high-value network. These hospitals have the lowest safety grades. What quality metrics did you actually use?"

**TPA rep**: 
"We use a proprietary algorithm..."

**CHRO**: 
"Can we see the methodology?"

**TPA rep**: 
"That's confidential..."

**CEO**: 
"So we're taking your word for it? On what we spend $100 million a year?"

**Question 3**:
"We found we can direct contract for 25% less than the rates you negotiated on our behalf. Why are we paying you to get us worse rates?"

**TPA rep**: 
"Our network provides broad access..."

**CFO**: 
"But this data shows the direct contracts include 80% of the providers we actually use."

**Question 4**:
"The cash price at this hospital is $15,000. Your negotiated rate is $28,000. How does that happen when you're supposed to be negotiating on our behalf?"

**Consultant**: 
"Well, cash prices are different..."

**Procurement officer**: 
"In what other industry would we pay almost double what an uninsured person pays and call that 'negotiated'?"

**Awkward silence**

### The Defenses That Don't Work Anymore

**Defense #1**: "It's too complex for you to understand"
**Employer's response**: "We just understood it. We hired an analyst. They figured it out in 3 months."

**Defense #2**: "The data is unusable"
**Employer's response**: "PBGH used it. Milliman used it. Other employers are using it. Try again."

**Defense #3**: "You need us for network access"
**Employer's response**: "We can direct contract. We can buy a wraparound network for $18 PMPM. What exactly do we need you for?"

**Defense #4**: "This is industry standard"
**Employer's response**: "Then the industry standard is ripping us off. We're changing standards."

**Defense #5**: "Trust us, we're getting you great rates"
**Employer's response**: "We don't trust you. We verify now. That's what this data is for."

### The Outcomes of These Conversations

**For Conflicted Consultants/TPAs**:
- Lost accounts
- Reduced fees
- Forced transparency in contracts
- Having to actually compete on value
- Career risk for individuals who misled clients

**For Unconflicted Consultants/TPAs**:
- Opportunity to win dissatisfied accounts
- Ability to prove their value with data
- Competitive advantage (finally!)
- Market differentiation
- Growing demand for real expertise

**Elizabeth Mitchell on the opportunity**:
"This is actually really good news if you're a consultant and you're listening to this. Because probably for the first time ever, there are clients and customers who are now able to see and check themselves who is conflicted and unconflicted."

## Part 4: The Fiduciary Duty Reality Check

### What Changed with the CAA

**Before CAA** (pre-2021):
- Employer fiduciary duty was murky
- Could claim "we relied on our consultant"
- Could outsource decision-making
- Limited legal risk

**After CAA** (2021 forward):
- Crystal clear: Fiduciary duty sits with employer
- Individual executives personally liable (CHRO, CFO, SVP)
- CANNOT outsource the risk
- "My consultant told me" is not a defense
- Must use available data and tools
- NOT using transparency data when it exists = negligence

**Elizabeth Mitchell**:
"You can't outsource the risk. That's the bottom line. You can't."

### What This Means in Plain English

**You Are Accountable For**:
- Paying fair prices (not just "discounted" prices)
- Getting quality care for employees
- Ensuring safety
- Managing costs effectively
- Using available transparency tools
- Questioning consultants and TPAs
- Verifying claims, not just accepting them

**You Are NOT Protected By**:
- "We trusted our consultant"
- "The carrier said it was a good deal"
- "We've always done it this way"
- "It's too complicated"
- "The data is unusable"

### The Legal Risk

**What Could Happen**:
- Employee/beneficiary lawsuits (class action)
- Department of Labor investigations
- Personal liability for executives
- Fiduciary breach claims
- Penalties and damages

**What Triggers This**:
- Evidence you knew you were overpaying
- Evidence you ignored available data
- Evidence you didn't question obvious problems
- Evidence you prioritized consultant relationships over employee interests

**The PBGH Data as Evidence**:
Once this data exists and is widely known:
- NOT using it becomes harder to justify
- Continuing to overpay becomes provable negligence
- "We didn't know" stops being credible

**Elizabeth Mitchell**:
"If you're a self-insured employer, it is irresponsible to not use this data. You have it, it is available, and if you don't use it, you (A) have a compliance risk...but (B) how do you tackle affordability?"

### The Defensive Compliance vs. Strategic Opportunity

**Defensive (Compliance)**:
- Use data to avoid lawsuits
- Document decision-making
- Show you did due diligence
- Protect against DOL inquiries

**Strategic (Business Value)**:
- Reduce costs by 10-30%
- Improve employee health outcomes
- Competitive advantage in talent market
- Better benefits at lower cost
- Stronger balance sheet

**Smart Employers Do Both**:
Use transparency data to:
1. Comply with fiduciary duty (defense)
2. Dramatically improve their business (offense)

---

## Part 5: The Market Transformation Underway

### What Happens When Customers Have Real Data

**Traditional Market Dynamics** (before transparency):
```
Provider: Sets high prices
Carrier/TPA: "Negotiates" (wink, wink)
Consultant: Shows discount reports
Employer: Doesn't know real prices, accepts renewal
Employee: Gets surprised by bill

Result: Prices keep rising, nobody's accountable
```

**New Market Dynamics** (with transparency):
```
Provider: Sets prices
PBGH Data: Shows real prices + quality + safety scores
Employer: Compares to peers, benchmark, quality
Employer to TPA: "Explain this"
TPA: Can't
Employer: Fires TPA or renegotiates contract
Employee: Gets better care at lower cost

Result: Competition on value, accountability, rational market
```

### The Cascading Effects

**Effect 1: Consultant/TPA Shakeout**
- Conflicted consultants lose clients
- Unconflicted consultants win new business
- TPAs forced to justify fees
- Transparency becomes table stakes
- "Trust me" no longer works

**Effect 2: Provider Competition Shifts**
- Can no longer compete on brand/billboards alone
- Quality and safety scores matter
- Price transparency forces efficiency
- High-value providers win volume
- Low-value providers lose volume

**Effect 3: Direct Contracting Accelerates**
- Employers bypass TPAs
- Negotiate directly with providers
- Better rates, better terms
- Simpler contracts
- Cash payment upfront

**Effect 4: Network Redesign**
- Employers create own high-value networks
- Based on real quality data
- Based on fair prices
- Exclude expensive/low-quality providers
- Drive volume to high-value partners

**Effect 5: Employee Benefits Improve**
- Lower premiums
- Lower deductibles
- $0 copays at preferred providers
- Better access to quality care
- More money in paychecks

### Real Example: The Virtuous Cycle

**Starting Point**:
- Employer spending $100M on healthcare
- Generic plan, TPA-negotiated network
- $3,000 deductibles, 20% coinsurance
- Employees struggling with costs

**Step 1: Get PBGH data**
- Discover 30% overspending = $30M
- Identify high-value providers
- See direct contract opportunities

**Step 2: Redesign approach**
- Direct contract with 3 key providers (20% savings)
- Create narrow network of high-quality, fair-priced providers (15% savings)
- Negotiate cash prices for imaging/labs (40% savings on those services)
- Total potential savings: $25M

**Step 3: Reinvest savings**
- Lower deductibles: $3,000 → $500 (costs $5M)
- $0 copays at preferred providers (costs $3M)
- Raise wages 3% (costs $10M)
- Still $7M left for employer's bottom line

**Results**:
- Employees: Better benefits + higher wages + easier access to care
- Employer: Better outcomes + lower costs + competitive advantage
- Providers (good ones): More volume + better terms
- Consultants (good ones): Prove value + win more business
- Society: Healthcare system starts functioning rationally

**Who Loses**:
- Conflicted consultants
- TPAs extracting spread pricing
- Low-quality, high-price providers
- Status quo that was extracting billions

### The Scaling Question

**Current State**: 
- PBGH proved this works
- Handful of large employers participating
- Results are dramatic
- Demand is overwhelming

**Next Phase** (2026 and beyond):
- PBGH scaling the program
- Any employer can participate (not just members)
- More data partners joining
- More employers discovering the truth
- Competitive pressure to adopt

**The Tipping Point**:
Once enough large employers do this:
- Becomes industry standard
- Fast followers jump in
- Consultants forced to adapt
- TPAs forced to be transparent
- Providers forced to compete on value
- Market transforms

**Shane Cerone's insight** (from transcript):
"We don't have a broken healthcare market. We don't have a healthcare market."

**Elizabeth Mitchell's response**:
"This is a step towards making a more rational market."

## Part 6: The Human Impact - Why This Matters Beyond the Spreadsheets

### The Cora Opsahl Math (from previous transcript)

**Over 10 years**:
- Member wages went up: 50%
- Healthcare costs went up: 230%

**If healthcare had just gone up with inflation**:
- Members would have $5,000+ more per year in their pockets

**What $5,000 means to a family**:
- Groceries for 4 months
- A vacation
- School supplies for the year
- Car repairs
- Emergency savings
- A small business down payment
- Retirement contribution
- Children's college fund

**Current reality**:
All that money went to healthcare spread pricing, unnecessary expensive care, and administrative bloat instead.

### The Safety Impact

**Dr. John Rodis Story** (mentioned in transcript):
- Became CEO of hospital
- Hospital had low Leapfrog grade (D)
- D grade = patients twice as likely to die from preventable error
- He worked hard to improve quality
- Achieved higher grade
- Expected volume increase (employers would steer patients)
- Result: Crickets. No volume change.

**Why?**
Because employers didn't have the data to know his hospital got safer.

**With PBGH data**:
- Employers can see Leapfrog scores
- Can see quality improvements
- Can steer patients to safest hospitals
- Can reward providers who improve
- Safety becomes competitive advantage

**Human Impact**:
- Sarah doesn't go to the C-grade hospital (where she's 2× more likely to die)
- She goes to the A-grade hospital
- She survives her surgery without complications
- She goes home to her kids
- She stays in the workforce
- She lives a full life

**That's what transparency does**: It saves lives, not just money.

### The Access Impact

**Current Crisis**:
- Rural hospital closures
- Maternity care deserts
- Primary care shortage
- Mental health access problems
- Specialist wait times

**Root Cause** (partially):
Money is going to:
- Expensive, low-value care
- Administrative bloat
- Spread pricing
- Unnecessary procedures
- Wrong sites of service

**With Transparency**:
- Employers identify $25M in overspending
- Can redirect money to: Primary care, Mental health, Maternity care
- Can direct contract with rural providers
- Can fund care in underserved areas

**Elizabeth Mitchell**:
"Helping the employers identify money they're overspending, that they may be able to reinvest in primary care or reinvest in maternity or mental health care. Things that they really value, where the needs are unmet."

**Human Impact**:
- Maria gets mental health counseling (previously unaffordable)
- She manages her depression
- She stays employed, stays off disability
- Her kids have a functioning parent
- Her employer keeps a valuable employee

### The Dignity Impact

**Current Experience**:
1. Get sick
2. See doctor
3. Receive mysterious bill weeks later
4. Amount is shocking
5. Can't pay it
6. Go into debt
7. Avoid future care
8. Get sicker
9. Repeat

**With Transparency**:
1. Get sick
2. Navigation service shows options: Quality A hospital ($0 copay), Quality A hospital across town ($0 copay), Quality C hospital ($2,000 copay)
3. Choose Quality A hospital near home
4. Know cost before care
5. Receive excellent care
6. Pay $0
7. Don't avoid future care
8. Stay healthy
9. Live life

**The Difference**:
- No surprise bills
- No debt
- No delayed care
- No choosing between food and medicine
- Dignity restored

**Mark Cuban's vision** (from previous transcript):
"Back to 1955 where you can pay with a credit card, cash, or a chicken."

**What this means**:
- Simple pricing
- Know costs upfront
- Fair prices (chicken-proportionate)
- No mystery
- No shock
- No debt collection
- No billing department with more staff than doctors

**That's the world transparency enables**.

## Part 7: Your Role in This Transformation

### What This Means for Your Work in Transparency

**You Are Building**:
Not just tools. Not just dashboards. Not just reports.

You are building:
- The infrastructure for a functioning market
- The tools that expose conflicts of interest
- The data that empowers patients and employers
- The evidence that saves lives and money
- The transparency that restores dignity

**The Stakes**:
- $4.9 trillion healthcare sector
- 160 million Americans in self-insured plans
- Families choosing between food and medicine
- Lives lost to preventable errors
- Billions wasted on administrative complexity

**Your Tools Enable**:
- Employers to see they're being overcharged
- Employees to find safe, affordable care
- Good consultants to prove their value
- Good providers to compete and win
- Bad actors to be exposed and held accountable
- Markets to function rationally
- Healthcare to become affordable again

### The PBGH Proof Points for Your Work

**When people say**: "The data is too messy"
**You say**: "PBGH proved it's usable. Milliman made it work."

**When people say**: "Nobody wants this"
**You say**: "Employer demand is overwhelming. PBGH can't keep up."

**When people say**: "It won't change anything"
**You say**: "Employers found 30% overspending and are redesigning entire programs."

**When people say**: "The industry won't let it happen"
**You say**: "It's already happening. TPAs are being called to HQ to explain themselves."

**When people say**: "It's not worth the effort"
**You say**: "Families could have $5,000 more per year. People could get safe care. That's worth it."

### The Three Audiences for Your Tools

**Audience 1: Employers/Plan Sponsors**
What they need:
- See what they're actually paying (not "discounts")
- Compare to peers and benchmarks
- See quality and safety scores
- Identify overspending
- Design better networks
- Hold TPAs/consultants accountable
- Meet fiduciary duty

Your value proposition:
"You're paying 30% more than you should. We can show you where and how to fix it."

**Audience 2: Employees/Patients**
What they need:
- Know costs before care
- Find high-quality, safe providers
- Avoid surprise bills
- Make informed choices
- Access affordable care
- Not go into debt

Your value proposition:
"Know what you'll pay before you get care. Find the safest, most affordable options."

**Audience 3: Good Actors (Consultants/TPAs/Providers)**
What they need:
- Prove their value
- Differentiate from bad actors
- Show real results
- Win business
- Compete on value not opacity

Your value proposition:
"Finally, clients can see who's actually helping them. That's you. Let's prove it."

### The Features Your Tools Must Have

Based on PBGH's success and employer needs:

**Feature 1: Multi-Source Data Integration**
- Combine claims + transparency data + quality + safety
- Like PBGH did - don't rely on single source
- Triangulate for reliability

**Feature 2: Peer Benchmarking**
- Show "You pay $X, peers pay $Y"
- Make overspending obvious
- Create urgency for change

**Feature 3: Quality/Safety Overlay**
- Never show price without quality
- Leapfrog scores integrated
- Outcomes data visible
- "No good price for unsafe care"

**Feature 4: Actionable Insights**
- Not just data, but "Do this"
- "Use this provider instead"
- "You could save $X by doing Y"
- "These are high-value options"

**Feature 5: Decision Support**
- Help employers design networks
- Model savings scenarios
- Show ROI clearly
- Support fiduciary documentation

**Feature 6: Transparency About Transparency**
- Show methodology
- Explain data sources
- Admit limitations
- Build trust through honesty

**Feature 7: Conflict-of-Interest Disclosure**
- Who pays you?
- Who do you pay?
- What relationships exist?
- Be unconflicted or be transparent about conflicts

### The Business Model Questions

**PBGH's Key Partner: Peterson Center**
- Philanthropic funding
- Zero conflicts
- Mission-aligned
- Enabled unbiased work

**The Challenge**:
Most transparency efforts can't rely on philanthropy. Need sustainable business model.

**The Opportunity**:
PBGH proved enormous demand from employers. They'll pay for this.

**Possible Models**:

**Model 1: Subscription (Employer Direct)**
- Employers pay annual fee
- Access to platform
- Regular updates
- Support services
- Scales with employer size

**Model 2: TPA/Consultant Partnership**
- Partner with unconflicted TPAs/consultants
- They integrate into their offerings
- You provide data/tools
- Rev share model

**Model 3: Carrier Partnership (Carefully)**
- Work with carriers who want to compete on transparency
- Must maintain independence
- Clear conflict disclosures
- Protect data integrity

**Model 4: Hybrid**
- Multiple revenue streams
- Maintain independence through diversity
- No single payer controls you

**Critical Rule** (from PBGH experience):
"It requires an unconflicted partner to do this." - Elizabeth Mitchell

Maintain independence or you'll be captured by incumbent interests.

### The Competitive Landscape

**Incumbent Players** (Who Might Resist):
- Traditional consultants with conflicts
- TPAs making money on spread
- Carriers with opaque contracts
- Providers who overcharge
- PBMs with hidden fees

**Emerging Players** (Potential Partners):
- Unconflicted consultants
- Independent TPAs
- Provider organizations competing on value
- Self-insured employer groups
- Direct contracting facilitators

**Your Positioning**:
You're not attacking anyone. You're enabling markets to function.
When markets function, good actors win. Bad actors lose.
That's how it should work.

### The Change Management Reality

**Resistance Will Come From**:
- "We've always done it this way"
- "Our relationships will be damaged"
- "This is too disruptive"
- "We're not ready for this"
- "The data isn't perfect"

**Your Response**:
- "Yes, and the current way costs $5,000 per family unnecessarily"
- "Which relationships? With vendors overcharging you?"
- "The status quo is unsustainable. This is less disruptive than bankruptcy"
- "CAA says you must be ready. You're liable if you're not"
- "Perfect is the enemy of good. PBGH proved it's usable now"

**The Adoption Curve**:

**Innovators** (2%): Already using PBGH data
**Early Adopters** (13%): Joining PBGH program in 2026
**Early Majority** (34%): Fast followers, will join 2026-2027
**Late Majority** (34%): Will join when competitive pressure forces them
**Laggards** (16%): Will get sued or lose talent, forced to adapt

**Your focus**: Serve the first three groups (49% of market). Make their success visible. Let that pull the others.

## Conclusion: The Moment We're In

### The Wright Brothers Moment

December 17, 1903: First powered flight
- 12 seconds
- 120 feet
- Proved it could be done

2024-2025: PBGH Transparency Project
- Combined cost + quality + safety data
- Proved it's usable and valuable
- Employers finding 30% overspending
- Proved healthcare transparency works

### What Comes Next

After the Wright Brothers:
- Skeptics said it was a fluke
- Critics said it had no practical value
- Industry didn't change overnight
- But within 10 years: commercial aviation began
- Within 25 years: transatlantic flight
- Within 40 years: jet age
- Within 70 years: moon landing

**The trajectory once you prove something is possible: exponential**

After PBGH:
- Skeptics will say it can't scale
- Critics will say it won't change things
- Industry will resist
- But transparency is inevitable
- Markets require information to function
- Employers have legal duty to use it
- The dam has broken

### Your Role

You're not just building transparency tools.
You're part of the movement that fixes healthcare.

PBGH proved it works.
Now you help it scale.

**The opportunity**:
- Enormous demand
- Proven model
- Legal mandate
- Competitive advantage for early adopters
- Lives and money saved

**The responsibility**:
- Stay unconflicted
- Maintain independence
- Focus on patient/employer benefit
- Build tools that actually help
- Make transparency transparent

**The impact**:
Every family that keeps $5,000
Every patient who gets safer care
Every employer who competes better
Every good provider who thrives
Every bad actor held accountable

**That's because of your work.**

### The Final Word (from the transcripts)

**Elizabeth Mitchell**: 
"If you're a self-insured employer, it is irresponsible to not use this data."

**For your work**:
If you're building healthcare transparency tools, you're building essential infrastructure.
The market needs you.
Employers need you.
Employees need you.
Patients need you.

**The game is changing. You're changing it.**
