## Examples of Good Logs

### Example 1: Product Decision

```markdown
# Why We Built Modals Instead of Inline Expansion
**Date:** 2025-11-13 20:00:00
**Status:** ✅ Shipped
**Energy Level:** High

## The Spark
User testing showed inline card expansion disrupted the grid during presentations. Cards would jump around, making demos feel unprofessional.

## What Happened
Researched modern SaaS products (Notion, Linear, Airtable). All use modals for detail views. Implemented centered modal with dark backdrop, ESC key support, smooth animations.

## Strategic Insights
Presentation quality matters for enterprise sales. A polished, professional demo builds trust. Small UX details signal overall quality.

## Commitments
- Always test in "demo mode" before shipping
- Study enterprise SaaS patterns
- Prioritize presentation experience
```

### Example 2: Network Building

```markdown
# Coffee Chat with PBGH Benefits Director
**Date:** 2025-12-15 10-30-00
**Status:** 💎 Major Win
**Energy Level:** Very High

## The Spark
Cold email to PBGH contact. Mentioned their spread pricing case study. Got response in 2 hours.

## What Happened
45-minute call. They're overwhelmed with employer requests for help. Current tools don't exist. Showed my prototypes - they loved the spread pricing detector.

## Strategic Insights
- PBGH has distribution but no tech
- We have tech but no distribution
- Perfect partnership potential
- They'll intro us to 3 employers for pilots

## What's Next
- Send follow-up with demo video
- Build custom report for their next case study
- Propose formal partnership for their conference

## Network Impact
This could be the unlock. PBGH credibility + our tech = game changer.
```

## Goal of This System

**In 6 months, you should be able to:**
1. See your growth trajectory clearly
2. Identify what worked and what didn't
3. Have content for 10+ blog posts
4. Show investors/partners your thinking process
5. Feel the momentum you've built

**This isn't just documentation.**
**It's your story. Your proof. Your leverage.**
