## The Script

*[Opening - CONFIDENT, WARM]*

Hi, I'm **Ryan Gertenbach**.

*[Pause for emphasis]*

I'm building a **healthcare transparency platform** that helps patients, employers, and providers finally understand what healthcare *actually costs*—before anyone gets a surprise bill.

*[Shift to PASSIONATE, URGENT]*

Here's what I've learned: **Healthcare isn't broken by accident.** It's *designed* to be opaque. Patients can't shop. Employers overpay by 30% or more without knowing it. And high-quality providers? They're trapped in contracts that don't reward excellence.

*[Pause - let that land]*

The data to fix this **already exists**. Trillions of negotiated rates. Hospital cash prices. Quality scores. Medicare benchmarks. It's all public now, thanks to federal transparency rules.

*[Building energy - DETERMINED]*

But data without **action** is just noise.

So I've mapped out **50 use cases**—from spread pricing detection to network optimization to patient cost comparison—all built on real transparency data. And I'm bringing them to life, one prototype at a time.

*[Shift to MISSION-DRIVEN, PERSONAL]*

This isn't about disruption. It's about **dignity**.

It's about the single mom who needs to know if her kid's MRI costs $400 or $4,000 *before* she schedules it.

It's about the small business owner who discovers their pharmacy benefit manager is pocketing millions in hidden markups.

It's about the doctor who provides *excellent* care but can't compete because quality is invisible in our current system.

*[Strong, clear - CONVICTION]*

I believe **transparency is the first step to fixing healthcare**. Not the only step—but the necessary one.

*[Pause]*

So I'm building tools that make transparency **actionable**. I'm documenting the journey publicly. And I'm partnering with organizations like PBGH and Leapfrog who've been fighting this fight for decades.

*[Closing - INVITING, HOPEFUL]*

My goal? By April 2026, I want **real employers** using these tools to find real overpayments. I want **real patients** making informed decisions. And I want to prove that one person, with the right data and enough stubbornness, can move the needle.

*[Final line - DIRECT EYE CONTACT if video]*

Because healthcare **can** be better. It **should** be better. And someone has to build it.

*[Beat - then smile]*

So... that's what I'm doing.

## Alternative Shorter Version (30 seconds - Elevator Pitch)

*[Quick, energetic, memorable]*

Hi, I'm **Ryan Gertenbach**.

I build healthcare transparency tools using real negotiated rate data—the same data that hospitals and insurers used to keep secret.

I've mapped **50 use cases** from spread pricing detection to patient cost comparison, and I'm turning them into working prototypes.

My mission? Help patients know what things cost *before* they go, and help employers stop overpaying by 30%+ for healthcare.

Because **transparency isn't optional anymore**—it's the law. And someone needs to make it useful.

*[Smile]*

That someone is me.

## Usage Notes

### When to Use Full Script:
- Podcast introductions
- Speaking engagements (pre-talk setup)
- Video introductions for demos
- Networking events with time to speak
- Investor pitches (first 90 seconds)

### When to Use Short Version:
- Quick networking introductions
- LinkedIn video posts
- Conference name tag conversations
- Cold outreach follow-ups
- "Tell me about yourself" moments

### Emphasis Guide:

**BOLD ALL CAPS** = Strong emphasis, raise volume slightly
*Italics* = Softer emphasis, lean into the word
*[Pause]* = 1-2 second silence, let the point land
*[Beat]* = Half-second pause for rhythm

### Delivery Tips:

1. **Opening:** Start warm and confident—you've earned this space
2. **Problem section:** Let frustration show (controlled anger at the broken system)
3. **Solution section:** Shift to energy and hope—this IS solvable
4. **Personal section:** Slow down, get real—this is about people, not metrics
5. **Closing:** End with invitation and optimism—you want people to join you

### Power Words to Emphasize:
- **Transparency** (your north star)
- **Actually** (cuts through the BS)
- **Real** (not theoretical, real impact)
- **Dignity** (the human element)
- **Action** (you're a builder, not a talker)
- **Someone** (that's you—own it)

## Customization Prompts

### For Employer Audiences:
Replace patient example with:
> "It's about the CFO who discovers they're paying $500 for a blood test that costs Medicare $12—and they've been doing it for 10 years."

### For Provider Audiences:
Replace closing with:
> "I want to help high-quality providers prove their value, get paid fairly, and build direct relationships with patients who actually care about excellence."

### For Policy/Advocacy Audiences:
Add after transparency line:
> "The Transparency in Coverage rule and Hospital Price Transparency mandates gave us the data. But compliance isn't enough—we need tools that turn compliance into competition."

### For Investor Audiences:
Add before closing:
> "This isn't a nice-to-have. Self-insured employers spend $700 billion a year. If we can help them save even 10%, that's a $70 billion market. And patients? They're drowning in medical debt. This solves real problems with real economics."

## Authenticity Check

**Does this sound like YOU?**
- If not, adjust the language to match your natural speaking style
- The script should feel like an elevated version of how you already talk
- Don't use words you wouldn't say in a real conversation
- If a line feels performative, cut it or rewrite it

**The Ryan Test:**
Would the person reading your secret page ([secret.html?yobro](../../../secret.html?yobro)) recognize this voice? If yes, you're good. If no, make it more real.

## Final Thought

This script is a tool, not a cage. Use it as a foundation, but:
- Adapt it for your audience
- Let your passion show through
- Don't memorize word-for-word (you'll sound robotic)
- Internalize the **themes**, then speak from the heart

**You're not performing a role. You're introducing yourself as the person you're becoming.**

And that person? That person is building something real.
