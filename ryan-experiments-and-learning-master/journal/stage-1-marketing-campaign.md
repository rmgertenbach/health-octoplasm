# Stage 1 Marketing Campaign: Problem Awareness
## "You're Being Overcharged (And You Didn't Even Know It)"

**Campaign Duration:** Months 1-2
**Goal:** Help each persona realize they have a problem they didn't know existed
**Success Metric:** 30% of visitors identify with at least one pain point and take next action (email signup, share content, or explore further)

---

## Campaign Philosophy

**The Core Strategy:**
People don't seek solutions to problems they don't know exist. This campaign reveals hidden problems through:
1. **Shocking revelations** - Data that contradicts what they've been told
2. **Relatable stories** - Real people experiencing real pain
3. **Permission to question** - "It's not your fault, but now you know"
4. **Proof points** - PBGH study, real numbers, verifiable data

**What We're NOT Doing:**
- Selling products (not yet)
- Being preachy or judgmental
- Overwhelming with complexity
- Making them feel stupid

**What We ARE Doing:**
- Opening eyes to hidden realities
- Creating "I'm not alone" moments
- Building trust through transparency
- Establishing authority through data

## 🏥 AUDIENCE 1: PATIENTS/CONSUMERS

### Content Piece #1: "Why Your Medical Bill Is Probably Wrong"
**Format:** Blog article (800-1,000 words) + social media carousel + short video
**Distribution:** Blog, LinkedIn, Facebook healthcare groups, Reddit (r/personalfinance, r/HealthInsurance)

**Hook (First 100 words):**
> You got a medical bill for $2,400. You stared at it for a week. You felt sick to your stomach—not from your condition, but from the number. You thought about calling the hospital, but what would you even say? "Is this right?" Of course it's right. They're professionals. They wouldn't send you a wrong bill... would they?
>
> Here's what the hospital billing department doesn't want you to know: **Studies estimate that 80% of medical bills contain errors.** That's not a typo. Eight out of ten bills. Your $2,400 bill? There's an 80% chance something on it is wrong.

**Key Messages:**
1. **Bills contain errors at shocking rates** - 80% statistic with citation
2. **You have rights** - No Surprises Act, negotiation power, financial assistance
3. **"Deductible" isn't the end of the story** - Claims can be miscoded, overcharged
4. **Cash prices often beat insurance** - Mind-blowing but true examples
5. **This isn't your fault** - System is designed to confuse and overcharge

**Data Points to Include:**
- 80% of medical bills contain errors (cite source)
- Average overcharge: $1,300 per hospital stay
- No Surprises Act protections (quick explainer)
- Example: ER visit billed at $2,400 → fair price $800 (based on Medicare benchmark)

**Call to Action:**
- Download: "5 Red Flags Your Bill Might Be Inflated" checklist
- Email signup: "Get free bill-checking tips every week"
- Share: "Tag someone who needs to see this"

**Social Media Cut-Downs:**

**LinkedIn Carousel (6 slides):**
1. "That $2,400 medical bill? Probably wrong."
2. "80% of medical bills contain errors"
3. "Your insurance said 'deductible' - but that might be a lie"
4. "Cash price at same hospital: $800. Your 'negotiated' rate: $2,400"
5. "You have rights. No Surprises Act. Financial assistance. Negotiation power."
6. "Free checklist: 5 red flags your bill is inflated [LINK]"

**Twitter/X Thread (8 tweets):**
1. You got a medical bill for $2,400. Insurance said "that's your deductible." You paid it. Big mistake. Here's why 👇
2. Studies show 80% of medical bills contain errors. That's not a typo. EIGHTY PERCENT.
3. Common errors: Duplicate charges, services you never received, upcoding (billing for expensive version of cheaper service), "facility fees" that shouldn't apply
4. Real example: Woman charged $2,400 for ER visit. Medicare pays $800 for same thing at same hospital. She was overcharged by $1,600—and nobody told her.
5. "But my insurance negotiated this rate!" That's what they want you to think. Often, insurance "negotiated rates" are HIGHER than cash prices.
6. You have rights: No Surprises Act (protects against surprise bills), financial assistance (many hospitals have programs), negotiation power (yes, you can negotiate)
7. What to do: 1) Request itemized bill, 2) Compare to Medicare rates, 3) Ask for financial assistance application, 4) Negotiate before paying
8. The system counts on you NOT knowing this. Now you know. Share this thread with someone who needs it. [LINK to full article]

## 💼 AUDIENCE 2: EMPLOYERS (Self-Insured)

### Content Piece #1: "The PBGH Revelation: Why 350+ Employers Discovered They Were Overpaying"
**Format:** In-depth article (1,500 words) + LinkedIn thought leadership post + webinar
**Distribution:** LinkedIn, benefits industry publications, PBGH network, direct email to HR/CFO contacts

**Hook:**
> Picture this boardroom moment:
>
> The CFO just learned her company is overpaying $2.1 million annually on healthcare. She calls in the benefits consultant—the one who's been assuring her for years that they have "great rates."
>
> **CFO:** "You've been showing us discount reports. Why are we paying 30% more than our peers?"
>
> **Consultant (stammering):** "Well, discounts are measured against chargemaster rates..."
>
> **CFO:** "So the baseline is meaningless? And you've been taking commission on these inflated prices?"
>
> *Awkward silence.*
>
> This conversation is happening at companies across America right now. **The PBGH Transparency Demonstration Project proved employers are systematically overpaying—and their "trusted" advisors knew.**

**Key Messages:**
1. **30% overpayment is the norm** - PBGH data proves it
2. **"Discounts" are fake** - Off meaningless chargemaster prices
3. **Broker conflicts are real** - Commission structure incentivizes higher costs
4. **You can't outsource fiduciary duty** - CAA makes YOU personally liable
5. **The data exists to prove it** - Transparency tools work (PBGH showed how)

**Story Arc:**
1. **The Setup** - PBGH project overview, who's involved
2. **The Discovery** - What employers found when they looked
3. **The Uncomfortable Moments** - Confronting consultants and TPAs
4. **The Outcomes** - Real savings, redesigned programs
5. **The Implications** - What this means for YOUR company

**Data Points to Include:**
- PBGH: "Employers paying 30% more than peers for identical care"
- Average employer overspending: $2-5M annually per $50M spend
- "Zero correlation between price and quality" - PBGH finding
- Direct contracts beat TPA-negotiated rates by 15-25%
- Spread pricing examples: $600K hidden on single infusion patient

**Real Uncomfortable Questions to Surface:**
- "Why are we paying almost double what cash patients pay?"
- "What quality metrics did you use for 'high-value network'?"
- "Can we see your fee structure and all conflicts of interest?"
- "Why did it take 10 months and attorneys to get our own data?"

**Call to Action:**
- Register for webinar: "How to Audit Your TPA for Hidden Fees"
- Download: "Questions to Ask Your Consultant Right Now"
- Join waitlist: "PBGH-style transparency analysis for your company"
- Email signup: "Employer transparency insights weekly"

**LinkedIn Article Version (Shorter, 800 words):**
Same structure, more punchy, ends with:
> If you're a self-insured employer spending $10M+/year on healthcare, you have fiduciary duty to your employees. The CAA says you can't outsource that risk. The PBGH data shows you're probably overpaying by millions.
>
> The uncomfortable question: What happens when your employees find out you knew and did nothing?
>
> The data exists. The tools exist. Ignorance is no longer an excuse.
>
> **What are you going to do about it?**

### Content Piece #2: "5 Signs Your Benefits Consultant Has Conflicts of Interest"
**Format:** Checklist article (1,000 words) + downloadable PDF + quiz
**Distribution:** LinkedIn, benefits publications, HR forums, email campaign

**Hook:**
> Your benefits consultant seems nice. They've worked with you for years. They always have answers. They show you impressive discount reports at renewal time.
>
> **Question:** Are they working for you... or against you?
>
> If you can't answer these 5 questions about your consultant, you might be paying millions to someone who profits when your costs go UP.

**The 5 Signs (Checklist Format):**

**🚩 Sign #1: They Won't Disclose ALL Revenue Sources**

*What to ask:*
- "Do you receive commission from our carrier/TPA?"
- "Do you receive bonuses, overrides, or incentive trips?"
- "Do you have ownership in or receive revenue from any vendors you recommend?"
- "What is your total compensation for our account, from ALL sources?"

*Red flag response:*
- "That's industry standard" (doesn't answer the question)
- "Our fee is transparent" (what about the other revenue?)
- "We have to make a living" (deflection)

*What it means:*
If they won't disclose = they have conflicts. Period.

**🚩 Sign #2: They Show "Discount Reports" But Not Medicare Comparisons**

*What to look for:*
- Renewal reports showing "40% off billed charges"
- NO comparison to what Medicare pays for same services
- NO comparison to what peers pay
- NO analysis of whether "discounts" are off inflated baselines

*Why it matters:*
40% off a price that's 300% too high = you're still overpaying 80%.

*What to ask:*
"Can you show me our rates compared to Medicare for our top 50 procedures?"

*Red flag response:*
"Medicare rates aren't relevant for commercial insurance" (FALSE - they're the most objective benchmark)

**🚩 Sign #3: It Takes Months to Get Your Own Data**

*Red flag behaviors:*
- Claims data takes 3-6+ months to receive
- Data arrives in unusable formats
- Told data is "proprietary" or "protected"
- Requires legal threats to get full claims file
- Only provides summary reports, not raw data

*What it means:*
They don't want you to see the truth. Your data reveals:
- Spread pricing
- Overpriced providers
- Billing errors
- How much you're really paying

*PBGH example:*
"One TPA took 10 months to release employer's data. Had to bring in attorneys. TPA kept saying 'it's proprietary.'"

**Translation:** "We don't want you to see how much we're overcharging you."

**🚩 Sign #4: They Push "High-Value Networks" Without Quality Metrics**

*What to ask:*
- "What specific quality metrics define 'high-value'?"
- "Can I see the methodology?"
- "Can I see each provider's quality scores?"
- "Are you excluding providers for quality or just for price?"
- "Do you have financial relationships with included providers?"

*Red flag response:*
- "Proprietary algorithm" (means "we made it up")
- "Industry-leading methodology" (vague, meaningless)
- "Mix of price and quality" (probably all price)
- Won't show actual quality data

*PBGH finding:*
"These so-called high value networks... Based on what? Based on what metrics?" - Elizabeth Mitchell

Most "high-value networks" = providers who give broker the best kickbacks.

**🚩 Sign #5: They Discourage Direct Contracting or Self-Auditing**

*Red flag statements:*
- "Direct contracting is too risky/complex for you"
- "You need our carrier's network"
- "Auditing rates will damage relationships"
- "Trust us, we're getting you great rates"
- "This is industry standard, everyone does it this way"

*What they're really saying:*
- "We make money on TPA relationship, not savings for you"
- "Transparency threatens our revenue"
- "We don't want you comparing our results to reality"

*PBGH finding:*
"The directly contracted arrangements were higher value than anything negotiated by the TPAs."

Translation: When employers negotiate directly = better results than paying consultants to negotiate.

**THE QUIZ:**
*"How Conflicted Is Your Consultant?" (Interactive Online Quiz)*

Answer yes/no to 15 questions, get score:
- **0-3 conflicts:** You might have an unconflicted advisor (rare!)
- **4-8 conflicts:** Moderate conflicts - time to ask tough questions

### Content Piece #3: "What Your Broker Won't Tell You About Spread Pricing"
**Format:** Investigative article (1,200 words) + infographic + calculator tool
**Distribution:** CFO/finance publications, LinkedIn, benefits forums, direct email

**Hook:**
> **Employer pays:** $28,000 for infusion therapy
> **Provider receives:** $12,000 for same infusion
> **Difference:** $16,000
>
> **Where did $16,000 go?**
>
> Your TPA took it. They call it "spread pricing." You call it theft.
>
> **For a $50M healthcare spend, typical spread = $2.5M-$5M annually.**
>
> **Your broker knows. They just hoped you wouldn't find out.**

**Structure:**

**Part 1: What Is Spread Pricing?**
- Simple definition with visual diagram
- How it works (TPA contracts with provider at $X, charges employer $Y, keeps $Y-$X)
- Why it's invisible (aggregated reporting, no line-item disclosure)
- Legal gray area (not illegal, but ethically dubious)

**Part 2: Real Examples**
- Infusion therapy: $1.2M charged to employer → $600K paid to provider = $600K spread
- Imaging services: 200-400% spreads common
- Specialty medications: PBM spreads of 600%+ documented
- Site-of-service: Same MRI, $3,000 hospital vs. $400 independent = $2,600 spread (all to TPA)

**Part 3: How They Hide It**
- No line-item disclosure in reports
- "Administrative fees" language in contracts
- "Proprietary pricing" claims
- Aggregated reporting (can't see individual claims)
- Contractual barriers to auditing
- Threatening legal action if you investigate

**Part 4: How to Detect It**
- Request data: In-network file + remittance amounts
- Compare: What TPA says they negotiated vs. what provider actually received
- Analyze: Calculate spread percentage by procedure/provider
- Document: Build audit trail for TPA confrontation

**Part 5: What to Do About It**
- Demand transparency clause in contract
- Require pass-through pricing (TPA makes $0 on spread)
- Audit rights in contract
- Switch to unconflicted TPA
- Direct contracting (cut out middleman entirely)

**Interactive Tool: "Spread Pricing Calculator"**

User inputs:
- Annual healthcare spend
- TPA/carrier name
- Access to claims data (yes/no)

Tool estimates:
- Likely spread percentage (based on industry data)
- Estimated annual leakage
- How much could be saved with pass-through pricing
- ROI of transparency audit

## 👨‍⚕️ AUDIENCE 3: PROVIDERS (Independent, High-Quality)

### Content Piece #1: "Why Independent Practices Get Paid Less for Better Care"
**Format:** Investigative article (1,000 words) + data visualization
**Distribution:** Physician publications, practice management forums, LinkedIn (target practice administrators)

**Hook:**
> You deliver Grade A care. Patient satisfaction through the roof. Better outcomes than the hospital system across town.
>
> **Your reimbursement for primary care visit:** $85
> **Hospital-employed doctor across town (same visit):** $140
> **Difference:** 65% more for identical service
>
> **Your patient volume:** Declining
> **Hospital system volume:** Growing
>
> **Why?** Insurance networks steer patients to hospital systems—not because they're better, but because they negotiated network access for higher rates.
>
> **You're not losing patients because you're worse. You're losing them because the system is rigged.**

**Key Messages:**
1. **Site-of-service payment disparity** - Hospital-employed = 40-80% higher reimbursement
2. **Quality is invisible** - Your Grade A outcomes don't show up in insurance directories
3. **Network steering** - Narrow networks exclude independents, favor systems
4. **Volume consolidation** - Patients don't choose hospitals, insurance design does
5. **Transparency can level the field** - But only if you know how to use it

**Data Points to Include:**
- Site-of-service differential: 40-80% higher pay for hospital-employed
- Volume shifts: Independent practices losing 15-25% patient volume to systems
- Quality data: Grade A independents vs. Grade C systems (nobody sees it)
- Direct contracting opportunity: $350K-$500K additional revenue per practice
- Employer demand: Self-insured employers actively seeking high-value independent providers

**Visual: The Rigged Playing Field**

*Side-by-side comparison graphic:*

**Independent Practice:**
- Reimbursement: $85
- Quality Score: A
- Patient Satisfaction: 95%
- Billing Burden: 1 biller per 2 doctors
- Network Position: Often excluded from narrow networks
- Volume Trend: ↓ Declining

**Hospital-Employed:**
- Reimbursement: $140 (65% more)
- Quality Score: C
- Patient Satisfaction: 78%
- Billing Burden: 10+ billers per department
- Network Position: Guaranteed inclusion (system negotiates all-or-nothing)
- Volume Trend: ↑ Growing

### Content Piece #2: "Employers Are Looking for You (They Just Don't Know Where to Find You)"
**Format:** Article (800 words) + case study + matchmaking concept
**Distribution:** Practice management publications, physician LinkedIn groups

**Hook:**
> Right now, a self-insured employer with 500 employees is sitting in a boardroom, looking at data that says:
>
> "You're paying MegaHealth Hospital $42,000 for hip replacements. Community Orthopedic does them for $18,000 with better outcomes."
>
> The CFO turns to the benefits manager: **"Why aren't we working with Community Orthopedic?"**
>
> Benefits manager: **"I've never heard of them."**
>
> **That employer wants to send you patients and pay you fairly. But there's no marketplace connecting you.**
>
> **Until now.**

**Key Messages:**
1. **Employer motivation** - Desperate to cut costs without sacrificing quality
2. **Direct contracting is growing** - PBGH proved it works better than TPA negotiations
3. **You have what they need** - High quality + fair pricing
4. **The barrier is discovery** - They don't know you exist
5. **Transparency creates marketplaces** - Your quality data + fair pricing = competitive advantage

**Case Study: Dr. Patel's Practice Transformation**

*Before Direct Contracting:*
- 800 patient visits/month
- Average reimbursement: $90/visit
- Monthly revenue: $72,000
- Status: Struggling, considering PE buyout

*After Landing 2 Direct Employer Contracts:*
- Added 200 employee covered lives (400 visits guaranteed/month)
- Direct contract rate: $125/visit (fair, not gouging)
- Additional monthly revenue: $50,000 ($600K annually)
- Payment terms: Cash within 15 days (vs. 90+ from TPA)
- Administrative burden: DOWN 50% (simpler contracts, no denials)
- Status: Thriving, hiring another provider

**What Changed?**
Dr. Patel created a transparency profile showing:
- Quality metrics (patient outcomes, safety scores)
- Transparent pricing (Medicare + 140%, or $125/visit)
- Patient satisfaction: 96%
- Same-day appointments available
- Direct contracting terms: No prior auth for primary care, 15-day payment

Two local employers saw the profile, did the math, and signed direct contracts.

**The Math That Convinced Employers:**

*Employer A (200 employees):*
- Current cost (via TPA): $180/visit average
- Dr. Patel's rate: $125/visit
- Savings: $55/visit
- Annual visits: ~800
- **Annual savings: $44,000**
- Plus: Better care, happier employees, simpler administration

*Employer B (300 employees):*
- Current cost: $190/visit
- Savings: $65/visit
- Annual visits: ~1,200
- **Annual savings: $78,000**

**Total practice impact:** $600K additional revenue + reduced admin costs + better terms

### Content Piece #3: "The Transparency Opportunity: How to Turn Your Quality into Your Competitive Advantage"
**Format:** How-to guide (1,200 words) + action checklist
**Distribution:** Practice management blogs, medical associations, LinkedIn

**Hook:**
> **For decades, you couldn't compete with hospital systems because patients didn't know:**
> - Your quality scores
> - Your fair prices
> - That you even existed as an option
>
> **The CAA changed that. Now all prices are public. Quality data is free. The playing field can be leveled.**
>
> **But only if you know how to use transparency as a weapon.**

**The 5-Step Transparency Advantage Playbook:**

**Step 1: Know Your Quality Data (And Own It)**

*What to collect:*
- Leapfrog scores (if applicable)
- Patient satisfaction scores
- Outcome data (readmission rates, complication rates)
- Board certifications, specialties
- Appointment availability (same-day? next-day?)

*Where to find it:*
- Leapfrog.org (free hospital safety grades)
- CMS Hospital Compare
- Your own patient surveys (Net Promoter Score)
- Internal outcomes tracking

*How to present it:*
- "Grade A Leapfrog Score"
- "98% patient satisfaction (vs. 78% regional average)"
- "2.1% readmission rate (vs. 8.4% regional average)"
- "Same-day appointments available"

**Step 2: Make Your Pricing Transparent (It's Required Anyway)**

*CAA requires you to post:*
- Cash prices (self-pay rates)
- Payer-specific negotiated rates (in MRF files)

*Go beyond compliance:*
- Post simple, consumer-friendly pricing
- "Hip replacement: $18,000 bundled (includes surgeon, facility, anesthesia, PT)"
- "Primary care visit: $125"
- "Compare to Medicare: We charge Medicare + 140% (industry average is + 250%)"

*Why this works:*
- Employers can see you're fair (not gouging)
- Patients can budget (reduces surprise bills)
- Transparency builds trust

**Step 3: Create Your "Value Proposition One-Pager"**

*For employers considering direct contracts:*

**[Your Practice Name] - Value Proposition**

**Quality Metrics:**
- Leapfrog Grade: A
- Patient Satisfaction: 96%
- Outcomes: Top 10% nationally

**Pricing:**
- Primary care: $125/visit (vs. $180 regional avg)
- Specialist consultation: $200 (vs. $350 regional avg)
- Procedures: Medicare + 140% (vs. +250% systems)

**Direct Contract Terms:**
- Cash payment within 15 days
- No prior authorization for primary care
- Same-day urgent appointments guaranteed
- After-hours nurse line included
- Annual wellness visits: $0 to employees

**Estimated Employer Savings:**
- 30% below current TPA rates
- Annual savings for 200-employee company: $44,000+

**Step 4: Target Self-Insured Employers in Your Area**

*Who to approach:*
- Companies with 200+ employees (more likely self-insured)
- Local manufacturers, tech companies
- Employers with high healthcare costs (older workforce, physical jobs)
- Companies that value employee benefits (recruiting advantage)

*How to reach them:*
- LinkedIn (find CFOs, benefits managers, CHROs)
- Local chambers of commerce
- Industry associations
- Direct outreach: "Would you be interested in saving $50K/year on employee healthcare while improving quality?"

*What to offer:*
- Free consultation: "Let me show you what you're currently paying vs. what direct contracting could save"
- Data-driven pitch: Use their own transparency data against them
- Pilot program: "Start with 50 employees, measure results, expand if happy"

**Step 5: Partner with Unconflicted Consultants**

*Who are they:*
- Benefits consultants who don't take carrier commissions
- Direct contracting facilitators
- Transparency analytics companies (like Payerset)
- Self-insured employer coalitions

*Why partner:*
- They're actively looking for high-quality providers
- They bring you employer clients
- They handle contracting complexity
- They prove your value with data

*How to find them:*
- PBGH network

## 🚀 Making It Happen

**This campaign reveals the hidden problems that Payerset solves.**

**For Patients:** You're being overcharged and you have power to fight back.
**For Employers:** You're overpaying millions and your advisors are conflicted.
**For Providers:** The system is rigged against you, but transparency can level the field.

**The goal isn't to sell (yet). The goal is to open eyes.**

Once they see the problem, they'll demand the solution.

**That's when Stage 2 begins.**
